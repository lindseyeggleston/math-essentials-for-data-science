Mathematical Essentials of Data Science
=============================================

If we use a transportation metaphor we might say that statistics and
`machine learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_
are the vehicles that take us to both new and familiar places.
We could also think of programming and `software engineering
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering>`_ as the roads
and infrastructure necessary to make travel even possible.  Linear
algebra on the other hand aligns well with the motors and engines that
propel our vehicles.

Most of us seldom think about *what is under the hood* as we hum
steadily along a nicely paved road, but success as a data scientist
requires at least a fundamental understanding.  Here we present the
essentials of `linear algebra
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra>`_ with the goal that
you become prepared for an educational experience in data science.
You may even come to believe that viewing math through the lens of
matrices and vectors **makes things easier**.

.. important:: The principal focus of this contents is to introduce
   numeric computing and **linear algebra** through Python.  A portion
   of the second day will provide a basis for the **calculus** that
   you will need as a data scientist.
