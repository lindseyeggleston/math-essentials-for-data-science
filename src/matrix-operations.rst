Dimensional requirements for matrix multiplication
----------------------------------------------------

.. important:: In order for the matrix product (:math:`A \times B`) to
               exist, the number of columns in :math:`A` must equal
               the number of rows in :math:`B`.


Basic properties of matrices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is convention to represent vectors as column matrices.  We are
explicit in this representation in that we define two axes even
through the number of columns is only one.

A **column matrix** in NumPy.

.. math::

    \mathbf{x} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    3  \\
    4  \\
    5  \\
    6
    \end{pmatrix}

>>> x = np.array([[3,4,5,6]]).T

.. note:: Again notice the pair of double brackets

The ``.T`` indicates a **transpose** operation.  In the case of
vectors we go from a rowwise representation to a columnwise one and
vice versa.  We will spend more time on transposes in the next
section.

A **row matrix** in NumPy.

.. math::

    \mathbf{x}^{T} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    3 & 4 & 5 & 6
    \end{pmatrix}

>>> x = np.array([[3,4,5,6]])

Since this is linear algebra essentials with the goal of preparing you
for a learning experience in data science, lets introduce a running
example that will help ground much of the notation and concepts.

Machine learning can be roughly split into two types of learning problems.

   * **Supervised learning** - learn a mapping from inputs :math:`\mathbf{X}` to outputs :math:`y`
   * **Unsupervised learning** - given only :math:`\mathbf{X}`, learn interesting patterns in :math:`\mathbf{X}`

An example of this is to predict total snowfall, which would be a
continuous :math:`\mathbf{y}`.  When we use a feature matrix
:math:`\mathbf{X}` to predict :math:`\mathbf{y}` it is an example of
**supervised learning**.  Our feature matrix would be a number of
column vectors :math:`\mathbf{x}` horizontally stacked together to
form :math:`\mathbf{X}`.  Examples of these features might be: the
elevation, latitude, average winter temperature, historical snowfall
data and more..

If we wanted to discover patterns in :math:`\mathbf{X}` then we could
take an such as clustering, which would be an example of
**unsupervised learning**.  Patterns in this case would likely
correspond to mountain ranges and meteorological or oceanic events.

If we think of the features of a matrix as column vectors.

>>> feature1 = np.array([[99,45,31,14]]).T
>>> feature2 = np.array([[0,1,1,0]]).T
>>> feature3 = np.array([[5,3,9,24]]).T

We can stack them into a matrix using ``hstack``.

>>> X = np.hstack([feature1,feature2,feature3])
>>> X
array([[99,  0,  5],
       [45,  1,  3],
       [31,  1,  9],
       [14,  0, 24]])

There are easier ways to create matrices, such as reading directly
from a csv file, but the ability to concatenate matrices is important.
With ``hstack`` we **horizontally** stacked our column vectors.  The
sister function ``vstack`` allows us to **vertically** stack vectors
or matrices in a similar way.

We may access the individual elements of :math:`\mathbf{X}` through **indexing**

.. math::

     \mathbf{X} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
     X_{1,1} & X_{1,2} \\
     X_{2,1} & X_{2,2} \\
    \end{pmatrix}

In the above matrix we show how to explicitly refer to any element in
:math:`\mathbf{X}`.  It is also quite common to refer to a generic
element in :math:`\mathbf{X}` as :math:`\mathbf{X}_{i,j}`, where if
you picked up on the pattern indexing occurs by stating the **row** then the **column**.
In NumPy you are following the same pattern.  Using the feature matrix created above:

>>> X[0,2]
5
>>> X[1,0]
45

And if we want to access our first column vector again

>>> X[:,0]
array([99, 45, 31, 14])

>>> X[:,0]
array([99, 45, 31, 14])

We now see that an array with 2 axes is indexed and even **sliced**
one axis at a time.  1D arrays can be indexed in the same way a Python
list can.

>>> a = np.arange(10)
>>> a[2:4]
array([2, 3])
>>> a[:10:2]
array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8])
>>> a[::-1]
array([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0])

If we go back to the ``X`` matrix there are many useful functions once we are here including ``mean``

>>> X.mean(axis=0)
array([ 47.25,   0.5 ,  10.25])
>>> X.mean(axis=1)
array([ 34.66666667,  16.33333333,  13.66666667,  12.66666667])

>>> X.mean()
19.333333333333332

.. note:: axis 0 refers to a mean with respect to the columns

Basic matrix operations
-------------------------

This has already been stated once.  But since it is important lets say it a different way.

.. note:: In order to multiply two matrices, they must be
          **conformable** such that the number of columns of the first
          matrix must be the same as the number of rows of the second
          matrix.


When we say multiply two matrices it does not mean multiply in the sense that you might think.
The **matrix product** of two matrices is another matrix.

If we have two vectors :math:`\mathbf{x}` and :math:`\mathbf{y}` of the same length :math:`(n)`, then the **dot product** is given by

.. math::

   \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y} = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + \cdots + x_ny_n

.. important:: Arithmetic operators in NumPy work **elementwise**

>>> a = np.array([3,4,5])
>>> b = np.ones(3)
>>> a - b
array([ 2.,  3.,  4.])

Something that can be tricky for people familiar with other programming languages is that the * operator
**does not** carry out a matrix product.  This is done with the
`dot <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html>`_ function.

>>> a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
>>> b = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
>>> a
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4]])
>>> b
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4]])
>>> a * b
array([[ 1,  4],
       [ 9, 16]])
>>> np.dot(a,b)
array([[ 7, 10],
       [15, 22]])

>>> np.dot(np.array([[1,2,3]]),np.array([[2,3,4]]))

The **dot product** is a very important concept that we will reuse many times going forward.  The dot product is generally written as

.. math::

   a^{T} b

when you write ``np.dot`` the NumPy package will sometimes assume that you mean to do this such as in the case of the above example.

>>> np.dot(np.array([1,2,3,4]), np.array([3,4,5,6]))
50
>>> np.dot(np.array([[1,2,3,4]]), np.array([[3,4,5,6]]).T)
array([[50]])

The dot product is an essential building block of **matrix
multiplication**. The table below shows that when we multiply two
matrices. The result is a table of dot products for pairs of vectors
making up the entries of each matrix.

First think about this in terms of square matrices and see if you can identify the pattern.


Perform matrix multiplication on a square matrix.  This is how it works---code the pattern.


.. math::

    \begin{pmatrix}
    a & b \\
    c & d \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \times
    \begin{pmatrix}
    e & f \\
    g & h \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    ae+bg & af+bh \\
    ce+dg & cf+dh \\
    \end{pmatrix}

Once you see what is happening this figure can help you understand how the pattern generalizes to different shape matrices.

.. important:: There is a pattern to figure out the size of the resulting matrix.
	  result = Num Rows in 1st matrix :math:`\times` Num Columns in 2nd Matrix

.. admonition:: Questions

   1. Given the following code write the multiplication out on paper **and** run it Python to check your math

      >>> np.dot(np.array([[1,2,3]]),np.array([[2,3,4]]).T)

   2. If we multiply a :math:`2 \times 3` matrix with a :math:`3 \times 1` matrix, the product matrix is :math:`2 \times 1`.

      Write an example of this on paper with simple numbers to see if you can understand why.

Special addition and multiplication operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like in regular Python there is a special operator.

>>> a = np.zeros((2,2),dtype='float')
>>> a += 5
>>> a
array([[ 5.,  5.],
       [ 5.,  5.]])
>>> a *= 5
>>> a
array([[ 25.,  25.],
       [ 25.,  25.]])
>>> a + a
array([[ 50.,  50.],
       [ 50.,  50.]])

Sorting arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NumPy has `a useful submodule to create random numbers <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/routines.random.html>`_

>>> x = np.random.randint(0,10,5)
>>> x.sort()
>>> x
array([0, 1, 5, 6, 7])

We can also reshuffle the array

>>> np.random.shuffle(x)
>>> x
array([1, 0, 6, 5, 7])

But sometimes we do not want to change our matrix, but knowing the sorted indices may be useful and here ``argsort`` can be very useful.

>>> sorted_inds = np.argsort(x)
>>> sorted_inds
array([1, 0, 3, 2, 4])
>>> x[sorted_inds]
array([0, 1, 5, 6, 7])

Common math functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

>>> x = np.arange(1,5)
>>> np.sqrt(x) * np.pi
array([ 3.14159265,  4.44288294,  5.44139809,  6.28318531])
>>> 2**4
16
>>> np.power(2,4)
16
>>> np.log(np.e)
1.0
>>> x = np.arange(5)
>>> x.max() - x.min()
4

There are `so many mathematical functions available to you in NumPy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/routines.math.html>`_

Basic operations exercise
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Exercise

   In the following table we have expression values for 5 genes at 4 time points.
   These are completely made up data.  Although, some of the questions can be
   easily answered by looking at the data, microarray data generally come in much
   larger tables and if you can figure it out here the same code will work for an
   entire gene chip.

   +------------+----------+----------+---------+----------+
   | Gene name  | 4h       | 12h      | 24h     | 48h      |
   +============+==========+==========+=========+==========+
   | A2M        | 0.12     | 0.08     | 0.06    | 0.02     |
   +------------+----------+----------+---------+----------+
   | FOS        | 0.01     | 0.07     | 0.11    | 0.09     |

   +------------+----------+----------+---------+----------+

   1. Create a single array for the data (4x4)
   2. Find the mean expression value *per gene*
   3. Find the mean expression value *per time point*

   **Extra Credit**

   4. Which gene has the maximum mean expression value?
   5. Sort the gene names by the max expression value

.. tip::

   >>> geneList = np.array([["A2M", "FOS", "BRCA2","CPOX"]])
   >>> values0  = np.array([[0.12,0.08,0.06,0.02]])
   >>> values1  = np.array([[0.01,0.07,0.11,0.09]])
   >>> values2  = np.array([[0.03,0.04,0.04,0.02]])
   >>> values3  = np.array([[0.05,0.09,0.11,0.14]])
