Here are just a few reasons why a solid understanding of linear algebra is **crucial** for a practicing data scientist

  * Linear models can concisely be written in vector notation
  * `Regularization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)>`_ often makes use of matrix norms
  * Matrix decompositions are commonly used in recommender systems

Scalars, vectors, matrices and tensors
------------------------------------------

Without knowing anything about vectors or matrices, there is already a
good chance that you have some intuition for these concepts. Think of
a spreadsheet with rows and columns.  Within a given cell there exists
some value---lets call it a `scalar
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics)>`_; scalars are
the contents of vectors and matrices.  If we think of the idea of a
column and the elements contained therein we now have a basis for the
concept of a `vector
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_and_column_vectors>`_.  More
specifically, this is referred to as a **column vector**.  The
elements of a row are accordingly referred to as a **row vector**.

We collectively refer to the columns and rows as a `matrix
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)>`_.

.. note::
    A matrix with :math:`m` rows and :math:`n` columns is a :math:`m \times n` matrix and we refer to :math:`m` and :math:`n` as **dimensions**.

If a matrix is a two dimensional representation of data then a `tensor
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor>`_ is the generalization of that
representation to any number of dimensions.  Lets say we copied our
spreadsheet and created several new tabs then we are now working with a tensor.

+------------------+----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

Matrices are also tensors.  If we were working with a :math:`4 \times
4` matrix it can be described as a tensor of rank 2.  The `rank
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra)>`_ is
the formal term for the number of dimensions.

.. admonition:: Questions

    1. So what are the dimensions of the following matrix?

    .. math::

        x =
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
        1 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\
        1 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}

    .. container:: toggle

        .. container:: header

            **ANSWER**

        The matrix dimensions are :math:`3 \times 4`

    |

    2. Given a spreadsheet that has 4 tabs and each tab has 2 rows with 3 columns how might we represent that data with a tensor?

    .. container:: toggle

        .. container:: header

            **ANSWER**

        The tensor would be of rank 3 and have the following
        dimensions :math:`2 \times 3 \times 4`.  In NumPy this is
        written as a :math:`4 \times 2 \times 3`.  You will soon be
        working with NumPy and you can refer back to this example.

	>>> x = np.array([[[ 0,  1,  2],
	                   [ 3,  4,  5]],
                          [[ 9, 10, 11],
                           [15, 16, 17]],
                          [[ 2, 10, 8],
                           [5, 4, 9]],
                          [[18, 19, 20],
                           [24, 25, 26]]])
        >>> print(x.shape)
	(4, 2, 3)

|

Notation
-----------

Scalars have the standard math notation

   .. math::

      x = 1

Vectors are denoted by lower case bold letters such as
:math:`\mathbf{x}`, and all vectors are assumed to be column vectors.


    .. math::

        \mathbf{x} =
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\
        1 \\
        2 \\
	3
        \end{pmatrix}


A superscript :math:`T` denotes the transpose of a matrix or vector.  This implies that :math:`\mathbf{x}^{T}` is a row vector.

    .. math::

        \mathbf{x}^{T} =
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 & 2 & 3
        \end{pmatrix}

Upper-case bold letter denote.

    .. math::

        \mathbf{X} =
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
        1 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\
        1 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}


An introduction to NumPy and Arrays
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes we need to write concepts on paper or see them in action
through code before we can effectively establish our understanding.
We will be learning the through a widely used Python package called
`NumPy <numpy.scipy.org>`_ to help bring to life the essentials of
linear algebra.

In order to get the most out of this resource and to ensure that you
can actively follow along it is easiest if you install a working
Python environment.

    :doc:`Python installation guide <install-python>`

.. important:: Familiarity with the Python language is not a
               prerequisite for this primer.  The included code blocks
               are minimal and you should be able to follow even
               without prior experience in Python.


Once Python is installed you can start an interactive Python
environment by typing the command ``ipython`` into a terminal.  `NumPy
<numpy.scipy.org>`_ is the *de facto* standard for numerical computing
in Python and it comes installed as part of the Conda bundle.  It is
`highly optimized <http://www.scipy.org/PerformancePython>`_ and
extremely useful for working with matrices.  The standard matrix class
in NumPy is called an `array
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array.html>`_.
We will first get comfortable working with arrays then we will ease
our way into the essential concepts of linear algebra.  NumPy will
provide you with a tool explore all concepts presented here.

The standard syntax for importing the package NumPy into a Python environment is

>>> import numpy as np

.. note:: Examples of code (like the import statement above) are line
          by line, where each line begins with `>>>`.  This means that
          you can copy the code that comes after the line indicator
          directly into your interpreter

Arrays and their attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python is an `object-oriented
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming>`_
programming language.  The main object in NumPy is the *homogeneous*,
*multidimensional* array.  An `array
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array.html>`_
is our programmatic way to represent vectors and matrices.  An example
is a matrix :math:`\mathbf{X}`

.. math::

    \mathbf{X} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3  \\
    4 & 5 & 6  \\
    7 & 8 & 9
    \end{pmatrix}

and can be represented through NumPy as

>>> import numpy as np
>>> X = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
>>> X
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9]])

Lets break down that code statement.  First

>>> a = [1,2,3]

is a native Python data structure called a `list <https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists>`_.  We could create a vector from this list using the NumPy array class.

>>> a = np.array([1,2,3])

So to create the above X matrix it is a **list of lists** where each row corresponds to a list.

Because our array version of :math:`\mathbf{X}` is an object it
contains methods and attributes.

 * The methods are functions that act on our matrix
 * the attributes are data that are related to our matrix.

Lets start with some useful attributes.  The array :math:`\mathbf{X}`
has 2 dimensions.  The number of dimensions in linear algebra
terminology is referred to as **rank**.  We get at rank with the
``ndim`` attribute.

>>> X.ndim
2

similarly we have access to the dimensions themselves through ``shape``

>>> X.shape
(3, 3)

Note that the number of axes is also equal to the or the length of ``x.shape``.  To return an integer representing the total number of elements one may use ``size``.

>>> X.size
9

.. warning:: If you want to work with a vector where the dimensions
             exist explicitly, you need to use double brackets.
             Otherwise it will be a 1D matrix and sometimes it may not
             give you the result you were looking for.

	     >>> np.array([1,2,3]).shape
             (3,)
             >>> np.array([[1,2,3]]).shape
             (1, 3)


Arrays and their methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have seen that arrays have built in attributes that are useful.
They also have numerous built-in methods that make them particularly
convenient.  Note that methods always have parenthesis that may or may
not enclose arguments.

>>> X.sum(axis=0)
array([12, 15, 18])
>>> X.sum(axis=1)
array([ 6, 15, 24])

>>> X.mean(axis=0)
array([ 4.,  5.,  6.])
>>> X.mean(axis=1)
array([ 2.,  5.,  8.])

Commonly used arrays can be created with functions that are part of
the NumPy package.  For example, to make a sequence of numbers, we can
use `arange <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html>`_.
This is similar to the standard python function `range <http://pythoncentral.io/pythons-range-function-explained>`_
that returns a list instead of an array.  Look carefully at the
following examples to see how it works.

>>> np.arange(10)
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> np.arange(5,10)
array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
>>> np.arange(5,10,0.5)
array([ 5. ,  5.5,  6. ,  6.5,  7. ,  7.5,  8. ,  8.5,  9. ,  9.5])

Also we can recreate the first matrix by **reshaping** the output of arange.

>>> X = np.arange(1,10).reshape(3,3)
>>> X
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9]])

In that function we created an array with values from 1-10 then we
reshaped it into a 2D array with 3 columns and 3 rows.  Another
similar function to arange is `linspace
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html>`_
which fills a vector with evenly spaced variables for a specified
interval.

>>> x = np.linspace(0,5,5)
>>> x
array([ 0.  ,  1.25,  2.5 ,  3.75,  5.  ])

As a reminder you may access the Python documentation at anytime from the command line using

.. code-block:: none

    ~$ pydoc numpy.linspace

The following plot visualizes ``linspace``.  It is an important function, but it less important that you understand the plotting portion of the code.

.. plot:: linspace-example.py
  :include-source:

.. important:: Did you notice that ``arange`` starts counting at zero?
               Python uses zero based indexing, so the initial element
               of a sequence has index 0.


This is a good time to introduce the idea that arrays may be made of
different types of data, but they can only be one data type at a given
time.

>>> x = np.array([1,2,3])
>>> x.dtype
dtype('int64')
>>> x = np.array([0.1,0.2,0.3])
>>> x
array([ 0.1,  0.2,  0.3])
>>> x.dtype
dtype('float64')
>>> x = np.array([1,2,3],dtype='float64')
>>> x.dtype
dtype('float64')

There are several convenience functions for making arrays that you should be aware of:

    * `zeros <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html>`_
    * `ones <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ones.html>`_

>>> x = np.zeros([3,4])
>>> x
array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]])
>>> x = np.ones([3,4])
>>> x
array([[ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.]])
